# User-Centered Design and Frameworks

## **1. User-Centered Design**
User-centered design (UCD) is a framework that focuses on designing products by keeping users front and center at every stage of the process. The goal is to create usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful experiences.

### **Steps in the User-Centered Design Process**:
1. **Understand**:
   - Learn about the users, their needs, and their problems.
   - Conduct research and gather insights.
2. **Specify**:
   - Clearly define user needs and the problems to solve.
   - Identify design requirements based on insights.
3. **Design**:
   - Create solutions using wireframes, prototypes, and mockups.
   - Iteratively refine designs based on feedback.
4. **Evaluate**:
   - Test designs with users to ensure they solve the problems effectively.
   - Collect feedback to improve usability and accessibility.
